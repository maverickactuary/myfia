<h1>The UKAPW content: Landing pages, missing content</h1>
<p id="para1">The UKAPW has a huge amount of high quality content, including hundreds of actuarial papers and presentations. There are other essentials: courses, exam results, meetings, CPD etc. Nonetheless, the content is not shown to best effect, as this page explains.</p>
<div>We can identify two types of content:</div>
<ol>
<li>content specifically written for the UKAPW e.g. introductory "landing pages"</li>
<li>presentations and papers written for other purposes, but linked to on the UKAPW.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first type of content is relatively poorly written, while the second is hard to find.</p>
<h2>[1] Content specifically written for the website</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.actuaries.org.uk/sitemap" rel="external">The UKAPW sitemap</a> lists 600-700 such pages &ndash; there may be more. 
In fact the sitemap lists only pages of this type; the sitemap contains no papers or presentations as far as I can see.</p>
<h3>[1.1] Landing pages: doorways to the main UKAPW areas</h3>
<p>The 10 main areas are introduced by what the UKAPW calls a "landing page". These pages should form a useful doorway into the area, but they are generally poorly written, with <a href="http://www.actuaries.org.uk/becoming-actuary/pages/becoming-actuary" rel="external">becoming an actuary</a> a possible exception.</p>
<div>Questions which should be addressed in a landing page, but often are not include:</div>
<ul>
<li>What material is covered by the area e.g. what is the definition and scope of ERM?</li>
<li>Who is the target audience and am I likely to be interested?</li>
<li>Where can I learn more?</li>
<li>How can I contribute?</li>
</ul>

<h3>[1.2] Improving the content</h3>
<p>Improving the landing page content would be relatively easy. We could involve a wider range of members of the profession in writing content, 
with users voting for the most helpful pages. Why not get collaborative a la Amazon and Wikipedia?</p>

            	<li>The "student events" appears to be the same events as on the home page.</li>
            	<li>The "student community" bar simply says "no groups". What does that mean?</li>
               	<li>The four graphical links at the bottom would be much better placed in the right hand pane, keeping the solitary "certificates for students" link company.</li>

            	<li>The central graphic is irrelevant and distracting.</li>
            	<li>The overall idea of communities is not stated.</li>
            	<li>The note that I am not a member of any communities is misleading; you need to be logged in for this to make sense.</li>
            	<li>The Hinton document under website feedback seems misplaced.</li>

<h2>Content recommendations</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Link the content to layout and navigation</li>
	<li>Drop the irrelevant home page content</li>
    <li>Make the "related links" related</li>
    <li>Improve the "landing" page content</li>    
</ol>

<h2>[2] Presentation and papers not specifically written for the website</h2>
<p>Typically the UKAPW hosts and links to actuarial papers or presentations. There are thousands of these papers and the responsibility for quality lies with the authors. But accessing them through the UKAPW is not easy and <a href="/content/3ConstructiveCriticism/BadLinks.html">bad links</a> occur with disappointing frequency.</p>
<h3>[2.1] Accessibility</h3>
<p>The main way of accessing such content is through the site search. None of it appears on the sitemap: this is fine, although see 
comment on "missing content" in [2.4].</p>
<h3>[2.2] Bad links</h3>
<p>The issue with bad links &ndash; both links which generate an error page and those which simply point to the wrong content &ndash; has been set out in some detail on our <a href="/content/3ConstructiveCriticism/BadLinks.html">bad links page</a> I have often notified the web team of bad links (and sitemap issues etc). I rarely get a response and the issues usually take months to put right &ndash; at best.</p>
<h3>[2.3] Consistency of content</h3>
<div>We claimed that "Consistent layout should in turn drive consistent content." Here's how this might work:</div><ul>
<li>Think about the content and what this might mean in terms of columns.</li>
<li>Confirm the purpose of columns 1 and 3 e.g. navigation, functionality, related links.</li>
<li>Start writing high level landing pages.</li>
<li>Confirm that you can populate columns 1 and 3 appropriately.</li>
<li>Continue this process with the lower level pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process will confirm &ndash; probably quick quickly &ndash; that the 3-column layout is appropriate (or not). Are the columns being used as expected? Is this easy or artificial?</p>


<p>Another thing which might help is a website "style guide", focusing on tone, grammar, length of sentence etc. This would be especially helpful if the UKAPW high level content became more of a collaborative effort.</p>

<h3>[2.4] Missing content</h3>
<p>This is a big one. It is impossible to find collected papers for past actuarial conferences. Apparently these were on previous versions of the site but not on the current version. Madness. The <a href="http:///www.soa.org" rel="external">SOA website</a> is better at this: see our <a href="/content/1CaseStudies/SOA.html">SOA case study</a></p>
