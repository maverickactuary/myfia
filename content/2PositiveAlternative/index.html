<h1>Positive alternatives to the UKAPW approach</h1>
<div id="para1">Rather than just offer <a href="/content/3ConstructiveCriticism/">constructive criticism</a> myFIA offers two forms of positive alternative:
<ol>
<li>Four <a href="/content/1CaseStudies/">case studies</a> showing websites that have adopted good practices and</li>
<li>Four "proof of concept" pages &ndash; covered here &ndash; give example implementations</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>[1] External demonstration: four case studies</h2>
<div>We look at four financial websites as case studies, comparing them to the UKAPW in terms of content, layout, navigation and functionality. Can 
the Profession learn from these sites?</div>
<ul><li><a href="/content/1CaseStudies/AIRMIC.html">AIRMIC</a> (risk management)</li>
<li><a href="/content/1CaseStudies/BOE.html">The Bank of England</a> (the UK's central Bank)</li>
<li><a href="/content/1CaseStudies/SOA.html">The Society of Actuaries</a> (a US actuarial body)</li>
<li><a href="/content/1CaseStudies/QFinance.html">QFinance</a> (a global finance resource)</li>
</ul>
<p>We find consistent patterns of how these sites implement key features of a website. All are superior to UKAPW in many respects. 
We can learn much from these sites.</p>
<h2>[2] Internal demonstration: four "proof of concept" pages</h2>
<p>I wanted to do more than criticise. More than point out that others had written sites better than the UKAPW and that 
standard approaches to website development were becoming clear.</p>
<p><strong>I also wanted to show that it's not hard to implement the suggested solutions.</strong> So I did it myself, in my spare time, with limited resources and no budget. The result: four pages that illustrate a radically different approach. This is scalable; 75% of the time was spent setting up a robust layout and style. myFIA could easily be extended to a 1000-page site.</p>
<h3>[2.1] Home</h3>
<div>My <a href="/content/2PositiveAlternative/Home.html">positive alternative home page</a> unashamedly mirrors the 
<a href="http://wwww.soa.org/" rel="external">Society of Actuaries</a>:</div>
<ul>
<li>Column 1: site functionality</li>
<li>Column 2: main content</li>
<li>Column 3: addtional navigation, related content and links</li>
</ul>
<p>The pages below also use this approach, with the exception of the sitemap. I have placed much less emphasis on what the site looks like and more on clarity of purpose and ease of use.</p>
<h3>[2.2] Practice areas</h3>
<p>The UKAPW has 10 main areas, each having a "landing page". Our <a href="/content/2PositiveAlternative/PracticeAreas.html">Practice Areas landing page</a> 
is the top level page for one of these areas, summarising the various practice areas. It follows the principles set down in [2.1] above. The content could no doubt be improved upon: it's the approach that matters.</p>
<h3>[2.3] Enterprise Risk Management</h3>
<p>ERM is a main practice area and a key focus for the profession. Our <a href="/content/2PositiveAlternative/ERM.html">ERM landing page </a> offers a 
alternative page for a single practice area. The layout is consistent with the previous pages.</p>
<h3>[2.4] Sitemap</h3>
<p>Following the <a href="/content/3ConstructiveCriticism/Sitemap.html">myFIA critique of the UKAPW sitemap</a> we provide <a href="/content/2PositiveAlternative/Sitemap.html">a positive alternative sitemap</a> There is a small compromise; to get a consistent appearance between the sitemap and the horizontal navigation we drop the first "functionality" column. But that shouldn't confuse.</p>
