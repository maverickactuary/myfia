<h1>Case Study 3: the Society of Actuaries (SOA)</h1>
<p id="para1">The <a href="http://www.soa.org/" rel="external">SOA website</a> and <a href="http://www.actuaries.org.uk/" rel="external">UKPAW</a> comparison is particularly relevant; both are websites of a national actuarial profession seeking to serve its members. 
The UKAPW was redesigned in 2010, but the SOA site remains easier to use, with more easily accessible content.</p>
<h2>The SOA's home page: highly functional and user-centric</h2>
<p>We can learn much from this excellent website. Most of the key information and functionality is on the home page, which conversely contains nothing unimportant. Please can we take a copy?</p>

<h2>The SOA layout</h2>
<p>The SOA site follows a hybrid design:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Column 1</strong> is the same across the site i.e. core "doing" functionality for actuaries who know what they want. 
This won't change much over time.</li>
<li><strong>Column 2</strong> is the specific site content. This has been carefully crafted, both on the home page (a call to action, events etc) and elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Column 3 where present</strong> is more complex and may contain:

<ul>
<li>"Related links" which are usually related to the main content.</li>
<li>News and obvious means of contact (on the home page).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="display: inline-block; height: 8px;">
	<br />
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: -8px;">
</div>


<div class="info pbbefore">
<h2>The column 3 and related links conundrum</h2>
<p>The SOA site and the UKAPW face the same issue: what do you do when you can't fill the third column with related links? UKAPW almost completely omits functionality, while SOA makes little attempt to show a navigation hierarchy. The issue will only grow over time as screen resolutions increase but, for readability purposes, websites do not want their main content column to be too wide. We somehow need more for the "other" columns.</p>
<p>The UKAPW approach of leaving the third column occasionally blank or showing
 odd content (e.g. "the European actuary" or "publication of the month") seems artificial. But even the SOA site faces challenges.</p>
<div>My overall approach would be:</div>
<ul>
<li>Use column 1 for functionality a la SOA.</li>
<li>Use the top part of column 3 for high level navigation a la QFINANCE's column 1.</li>
<li>This column 3 navigation is constant across pages, except that the current area/page is highlighted.</li>
<li>The breadcrumb can also do this highlighting.</li>
<li>Underneath the column 3 navigation have internal and external "related links".</li>
</ul> 
<h2>No easy solutions</h2>
<p>To a large extent, this is the approach I've tried to adopt on myFIA, albeit that myFIA has little functionality and hence no real column 1. 
If there is a substantial amount of content in the main column this can still leave column 3 rather empty (look to the right!)</p>

<h2>The SOA navigation: simple and intuitive</h2>
<div>The standard horizontal navigation is good. Key features of the SOA navigation include:</div>
<ul>
<li>8 high level sections, with the currently active section highlighted red.</li>
<li>Simple horizontal dropdown, with just one level.</li>
<li>Description of navigation links: short but generally meaningful.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a huge contrast here with the UKAPW website, reflecting badly on the UK site. The SOA site seems not to have a sitemap or breadcrumb, but the quality of the rest of the site navigation more than compensates.</p>

             Excellent, punchy level 1 content. This is a good illustration of how easy it is to write high level content for doorway pages. Each level one page just briefly describes the lower level pages.</td>

<h2>The SOA content: depth, simplicity and consistency</h2>
<p>The content has impressive depth, drawing the reader in. It is well categorised.</p>
<p>The top level pages have quality content, which integrates with the site navigation. Consider, for example, the section <a href="http://www.soa.org/professional-interests/landing.aspx" rel="external">professional interests</a> The section introduction states: "Discover information tailored to your specific areas of interest. Join a section for the first time, or reinvigorate your membership by becoming more engaged. Take advantage of the numerous networking opportunities or read the latest news and research."</p>
<p>Slightly longer introductions to the three sub-sections follow: (1) About professional interests (2) Sections and (3) Areas of interest. Helpfully, these are the same three links under the "Professional interests" part of the horizontal navigation. Again, straightforward and effective.</p>


<h2>Learning points for UKAPW</h2>
<h3>[1] Home page</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get a simple 3-column design</li>
<li>Put core functionality in the first column (say) and consider extending to all pages</li>
<li>Give the message conveyed by the slideshow / tabs more substance</li>
<li>Ditch the "design for design's sake"</li>
<li>In particular, reduce the number of images, giving simple text links more weight</li>
<li>Make the links more readable, shortening their text</li>
<li>Apply these last two ideas to eShop, events and publication of the month</li>
<li>Consider dropping the external news</li>
</ul>

<h3>[2] Layout</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make the home page layout simpler</li>
<li>Make the layout for all pages consistent</li>
<li>Use the third column clearly and consistently</li>
</ul>

<h3>[3] Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rewrite the content for most landing pages to give stronger introductions</li>
<li>If the purpose of the third column is to show "related links" make them related &ndash; this can be hard work for the reader.</li>
<li>Alternatively put something else there in addition, but do this consistently</li>
<li>Make (e.g.) papers and presentations from past conferences easily available online</li>
</ul>

<h3>[4] Navigation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Within the navigation, make the links more readable, shortening their text</li>
<li>Stop the horizontal menu being translucent</li>
<li>Make the horizontal navigation a simple dropdown or extend the number of links</li>
<li>In the latter case, consider making the horizontal navigation and sitemap consistent</li>
<li>Consider also making the site's folder structure simpler</li>
</ul>

<h3>[5] Sitemap</h3>
<p>Uniquely among the case study sites, the SOA site has no sitemap. Indeed it also has no breadcrumb and the sub-navigation is limited. 
Although I would not recommend this approach, 
the other methods of navigation (including the site search) are so strong that these omissions have little practical significance.</p>
