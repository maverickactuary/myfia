<h1>Case Study 1: AIRMIC</h1>
<p id="para1">Airmic has less content than our other case studies; looking at the site navigation indicates that there are around 50 main pages. 
The Airmic site has nonetheless been put together with care for appearance and ease of use. Like the other case studies, UKAPW could learn from its consistent approach.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.airmic.com/" rel="external">Airmic</a> is a membersâ€™ association, supporting those responsible for risk management and insurance within their own companies. Airmic provides research, training, networking, lobbying and market information for the benefit of individuals representing over 450 companies.</p>

<h2>AIRMIC's home page: modern but a little confusing</h2>
<p>The page packs a surprisingly large number of elements. Not all have an immediately apparent purpose and there is a certain amount of duplication.
The layout is nonetheless neat.</p>
<img src="/graphics/AIRMIC80.png" alt="AIRMIC" />
<p>The horizontal navigation (2) shows that the site has 6 areas, plus the home page and "contact us". There is duplication between (2) and the image links (5). Suggested improvements are listed at the end of this page.</p>

<div class="info">
<p><strong>Dare to be simple</strong><br />
Website owners get attached to their images; some regarding them as equivalent to their brand. If Airmic really wants to keep the extra four graphics they could insert a "quick links" piece of text between the first link (Airmic Academy) and the second link (Airmic SIGs). This gives "steer" towards the links, while indicating that they are duplicated elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Learning points for UKAPW</h2>
<h3>[1] Home page</h3>
<p>As with the other case study websites, <a href="http://www.airmic.com/" rel="external">the Airmic home page</a> is more compact than <a href="http://www.actuaries.org.uk/" rel="external">the UKAPW home page</a> The use of moving images for the topical information works; there is genuine 
content behind the links.</p>
<div>The UKAPW use of image tabs on its home page is particularly weak compared to both <a href="http://www.airmic.com/" rel="external">Airmic</a> 
and <a href="http://www.qfinance.com/home" rel="external">QFinance</a> Desirable features of image tabs include:</div>
<ul>
<li>The images display as a "slideshow", perhaps with pause / back / forward buttons</li>
<li>The image is clickable, with text explaining the image and the corresponding link</li>
<li>The message conveyed by the slideshow / tabs has real substance</li>
</ul>


<h3>[2] Layout</h3>
<p>Pages directly accessible from the navigation or sitemap have consistent and reliable layout. This layout forms a robust framework for a 
growing site. The third column clearly lists the pages in the current level of navigation.</p>
<p>Pages such as <a href="http://www.airmic.com/press-release/hazards-product-recall-and-crisis-management" rel="external">the hazards of 
product recall and crisis management</a> exemplify some content being rather "light" and the "related links" in the right hand column being 
weakly related.</p>

<h3>[3] Content</h3>
<p>The Airmic site lacks the depth of the UKAPW. But the combination of straightforward content and consistent layout makes a pleasing impression.</p>
<p>Simple but strong Airmic pages include <a href="http://www.airmic.com/about/secretariat" rel="external">The Secretariat</a>, <a href="http://www.airmic.com/research/joint-research" rel="external">Joint research</a> and <a href="http://www.airmic.com/research/reports" rel="external">Research reports</a></p>

<h3>[4] Navigation</h3>
<p>An important area in which Airmic excels compared to the UKAPW is navigation. Airmic navigation is simpler, easier to read and less wordy.</p>

<h3>[5] Sitemap</h3>
<p>Airmic has a <a href="http://www.airmic.com/sitemap" rel="external">simple but exemplary sitemap</a> The UKAPW's more extensive and complex content 
does not justify the inaccessible approach taken by <a href="http://www.actuaries.org.uk/sitemap" rel="external">the UKAPW sitemap</a></p>

<h2>Improving Airmic</h2>

<p>Though the AIRMIC site has clearly been thought through at a high level, there are some implementation details which could be improved. 
All the following points could be easily addressed in an hour, but illustrate some inferiority to the other case study sites. Unsurprising given 
the probable development resources available to each site.</p>

<h3>Airmic navigation: scope for improvement</h3>
<div>The breadcrumb works. The thinking behind the high level navigation is clear. The secondary navigation in the right hand column of lower level pages is useful and also shows where you are. There is scope for improvement:</div>
<ol>
<li>Label the images (5 in the home page image above) "quick links" and consider removing the duplication with the primary navigation.</li>
<li>When "Sponsorship is clicked it should load a specific Sponsorship page, not the lower level Airmic MarketPlace. There must be scope to explain about the Sponsorship section.</li>
<li>Similarly the Airmic MarketPlace should be set as Home &gt; Sponsorship &gt; Airmic MarketPlace in the breadcrumb and not Home &gt; Airmic MarketPlace.</li>
<li>A more straightforward solution to 2 and 3 is to drop the "marketplace" link from under the "sponsorship" menu then relabel "sponsorship" as "marketplace".</li>
<li>Highlight the currently active primary navigation area, in the same way that the currently active secondary navigation areas is highlighted green. The current approach  almost invisibly "greys" the navigation text.</li>
<li>Remove the SIGs (Special Interest Groups) from under the Events menu. Loading it from Events shows only three items under secondary navigation;
 the SIGs page is under the Members folder and navigation.</li>
</ol>
